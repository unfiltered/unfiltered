# Unfiltered

Unfiltered embraces the HTTP protocol, Scala, type-safety, and minimalism. It enables applications to handle HTTP requests as partial functions that take requests and return functions to respond to them. Typically, applications [pattern-match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) requests against nested extractor objects. HTTP responses are defined with response [combinator functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic).

The request response cycle reduces to a pattern matching clause similar to message handling in the Scala [actors](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242) library.

    object Server {
      def main(args: Array[String]) {
        unfiltered.jetty.Http(8080).filter(unfiltered.filter.Planify {
          case _ => Ok ~> ResponseString("Hello there")
        }).run
      }
    }

The above example starts an embedded web server at `http://localhost:8080` and responds to all requests with a "Hello there" message. It runs as a standalone Java application. You can also define filter classes, to be added by configuration to a servlet container like Tomcat or Google App Engine.

## Intents

Intents are the core library's interface for handling requests and responses. Specifically:

    type Intent[T] = PartialFunction[HttpRequest[T], ResponseFunction]

Intent functions pattern match against incoming requests and return a function that produces the desired response. Type parameters allow the client or extension library to directly access the underlying requests and response objects though the `underlying` method of `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`.

## Plans

Plans assign an Intent to particular request and response
bindings. For example, the trait `unfiltered.filter.Plan` defines a
`javax.servlet.Filter` that delegates to its`intent` method. The class `unfiltered.netty.cycle.Plan` defines a channel handler similarly. A future Plan trait might define a Servlet. Plan is a convention (and not currently a common interface) to apply an Intent to any request handling framework.

## Request Extractors

A request extractor is an extractor that accepts an HTTP request and returns a tuple of something useful along with the request to chain other extractors with.

An example signature would might be

    def unapply(x: HttpServletRequest): (Y, HttpServletRequest)
    
Unfiltered provides a library of extractors for matching common most HTTP requests attributes.

At the most basic level...

    GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD // match request methods
    
    Path // matches request uris
    
    Seg // matches request path elements
    
You can compose your own patterns using these and other extractors:

    PUT(Path(Seg("a" :: b :: "c" :: d :: Nil), SomeOtherExactor(foo, request)))


## Response Combinators

A response combinator is a function that takes a another function as its argument. Using these combinators, applications compose a function that acts on the Java servlet primitives to respond to the request. In general, applications employ these built-in combinators to act on primitives rather than referencing them directly, but they are free to construct responses ad hoc if necessary.

    type ResponseFunction = HttpServletRequest => HttpServletRequest
    
Core response functions are implemented as responders which can be chained together with `~>`.

These response functions are the expected return values of Intents.

A restful api for a given resource might look something like

    unfiltered.filter.Planify {
      case GET(Path(Seg("resource" :: id :: Nil), r)) => Store(id) match {
        case Some(resource) => ResponseString(render(resource).as(r match {
          case Accepts.Json(_) => 'json
          case Accepts.Xml(_) => 'xml
          case _ => 'html
        }) ~> Ok 
        case _ => NotFound
      }
      case POST(Path(Seg("resource" :: id :: Nil), Bytes(body, r))) => Store(id, body) match {
        case Some(id) => ResponseString(render("resource created").as(r match {
          case Accepts.Json(_) => 'json
          case Accepts.Xml(_) => 'xml
          case _ => 'html
        }) ~> Created
        case _ => BadRequest
      }
      case PUT(Path(Seg("resource" :: id :: Nil), Bytes(body, r))) => Store(id, body) match {
        case Some(id) => ResponseString(render("resource updated").as(r match {
          case Accepts.Json(_) => 'json
          case Accepts.Xml(_) => 'xml
          case _ => 'html
        }) ~> Ok
        case _ => BadRequest
      }
      case DELETE(Path(Seg("resource" :: id :: Nil),_)) => Store.delete(id) match {
        case Some(id) => Ok
        case _ => Gone
      }
    }

## Install

Unfiltered is a [cross built](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/CrossBuild) project, currently for the following Scala versions

    2.7.7, 2.8.0, 2.8.1
    
### via sbt

For standalone projects,  you'll want `unfiltered-jetty` as well as a
binding module:

    import sbt._
    class Project(info:ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) {
      val ufj = "net.databinder" %% "unfiltered-jetty" % "0.3.0"
      val uff = "net.databinder" %% "unfiltered-filter" % "0.3.0"
    }
    
To specify individual modules, specify the module name in the dependency.

    import sbt._
    class Project(info:ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) {
      val ufx = "net.databinder" %% "unfiltered-{module}" % "0.3.0"
    }
    
See the [template](http://github.com/n8han/Unfiltered/tree/master/demo/) application for an example of a basic Unfiltered application.

## Examples
There's an in-progress example app using Unfiltered made by [klaeufer](https://github.com/klaeufer), [unfiltered-example-bookmarks](https://github.com/webservices-cs-luc-edu/unfiltered-example-bookmarks). Also, most [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) templates for Unfiltered contain a bit of example code.

## Troubleshooting

### overly complex extractors 
    
If you design your partial functions in such a way that they become overly complex you might run into the following exception
    
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: ch.epfl.lamp.fjbg.JCode$OffsetTooBigException: offset to
    o big to fit in 16 bits
      
This is an open [ticket](https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1133) the the Scala library but this is not really a limitation of Scala so much as the jvm. 
  
As paulp put it
> Yes.  Like it says in the ticket, exponential space.  It is not the
> compiler which is angry, it is the jvm, which sets a hard limit on the
> size of a method.  The compiler's emotional state at that moment would

The work around is good software design. Break up your problems into parts and put them in separate filters. Don't give one Plan too much responsibility.
