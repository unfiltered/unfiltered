#### Meetup

Unfiltered, Netty, and RabbitMQ run [Meetup's real-time APIs](http://making.meetup.com/post/2929945070/real-life-meetups-deserve-real-time-apis).

#### Novus

Entire web layer of the [Novus](https://www.novus.com/) real-time financial analytics platform has been built by [maxaf](https://github.com/maxaf) using Unfiltered. We have a myriad custom request unapplies and use Scalate extensively. There's no better way to express web application concerns than using Scala idioms. High engineer productivity and type safety have contributed a lot to our product's bottom line.

#### Remember The Milk

Unfiltered is used in Remember The Milk's [public API](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/api/), [real time updates](http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2011/08/real-time-updating-comes-to-the-remember-the-milk-web-app/) and syncing endpoints for Android, iOS and Outlook.

#### Trust Metrics

[Trust Metrics](http://www.trustmetrics.com) uses Unfiltered everywhere.  We use it in our API, our client facing app, our intranet, and even our web crawler. We use it because it's simple and nonintrusive--it lets us decide how to add web to our app, unlike other frameworks (Grails/Rails/Django), which do all of the deciding for you.
