-----------------------

These are some projects and companies that have used Unfiltered.

#### Meetup

Unfiltered, Netty, and RabbitMQ run [Meetup's real-time APIs](http://making.meetup.com/post/2929945070/real-life-meetups-deserve-real-time-apis).

#### Novus

Entire web layer of the [Novus](https://www.novus.com/) real-time financial analytics platform has been built by [maxaf](https://github.com/maxaf) using Unfiltered. We have a myriad custom request unapplies and use Scalate extensively. There's no better way to express web application concerns than using Scala idioms. High engineer productivity and type safety have contributed a lot to our product's bottom line.

#### Trust Metrics

[Trust Metrics](http://www.trustmetrics.com) uses Unfiltered everywhere.  We use it in our API, our client facing app, our intranet, and even our web crawler. We use it because it's simple and nonintrusive - it lets us decide how to add web to our app, unlike other frameworks (Grails/Rails/Django), which do all of the deciding for you.
