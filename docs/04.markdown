Project Setup

### Modules and Artifacts

Unfiltered's core, binding, server, and other modules are published
with references to their underlying dependencies, so that applications
need only explicitly depend on Unfiltered and other top-level
dependencies. Keep in mind that server modules and binding modules are
not generally co-dependent, so that if you are using for example
unfiltered-jetty, you will also need to specify unfiltered-filter.

Each module is [cross-built][sbt] against several versions of Scala
and published to the [scala-tools][st] repository with the
organization-id "net.databinder". The modules have the Scala version
they are built against appended. For Scala $scala$, the full artifact
names are as follows:

* unfiltered_$scala$
* unfiltered-filter_$scala$
* unfiltered-filter-async_$scala$
* unfiltered-netty_$scala$
* unfiltered-netty-websockets_$scala$
* unfiltered-jetty_$scala$
* unfiltered-jetty-ajp_$scala$
* unfiltered-netty-server_$scala$
* unfiltered-uploads_$scala$
* unfiltered-util_$scala$
* unfiltered-spec_$scala$
* unfiltered-scalatest_$scala$
* unfiltered-json_$scala$
* unfiltered-scalate_$scala$
* unfiltered-oauth_$scala$

### Build Tools

With **simple-build-tool** it's best to have the Scala version
[automatically appended][sbt] so it will always match your
project's. In an sbt 0.10.x project:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.databinder" %% "unfiltered-filter" % "$version$"
```
For **Maven**, specify the full artifact name:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.databinder</groupId>
  <artifactId>unfiltered-filter_$scala$</artifactId>
  <version>$version$</version>
</dependency>
```

### Template Projects

For a new project the easiest the easiest option to apply a
[giter8][g8] template for the Unfiltered backend of your choice.

* **softprops/unfiltered.g8** for embedded Jetty
* **n8han/unfiltered-war.g8** for a servlet container
* **n8han/unfiltered-netty.g8** for Netty
* **softprops/unfiltered-gae.g8** for Google App Engine

So for example:

```sh
g8 n8han/unfiltered-netty --name=justplayin
cd justplayin
sbt # *or whatever your 0.10.x command is
> run
```
