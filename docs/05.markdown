Project Setup

### Modules and Artifacts

Unfiltered's core, binding, server, and other modules are published
with references to their underlying dependencies, so that applications
need only explicitly depend on Unfiltered and other top-level
dependencies. Keep in mind that server modules and binding modules are
not generally co-dependent, so that if you are using for example
unfiltered-jetty, you will also need to specify unfiltered-filter.

Each module is [cross-built][sbt] against several versions of Scala
and published to the [scala-tools][st] repository with the
organization-id "net.databinder". The modules have the Scala version
they are built against appended. For Scala $scala$, the full artifact
names are as follows:

* unfiltered_$scala$
* unfiltered-filter_$scala$
* unfiltered-netty_$scala$
* unfiltered-websockets_$scala$
* unfiltered-jetty_$scala$
* unfiltered-jetty-ajp_$scala$
* unfiltered-netty-server_$scala$
* unfiltered-uploads_$scala$
* unfiltered-utils_$scala$
* unfiltered-spec_$scala$
* unfiltered-scalatest_$scala$
* unfiltered-json_$scala$
* unfiltered-scalate_$scala$
* unfiltered-oauth_$scala$

### Build Tools

With **simple-build-tool** it's best to have the Scala version
[automatically appended][sbt] so it will always match your
project's. In a sbt 0.7.4 project:

    val uf_filter = "net.databinder" %% "unfiltered-filter" % "$version$"

For **Maven**, specify the full artifact name:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.databinder</groupId>
      <artifactId>unfiltered-filter_$scala$</artifactId>
      <version>$version$</version>
    </dependency>
