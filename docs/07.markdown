Pattern Matching Pitfalls
-------------------------

Java methods have a finite size, and the Scala compiler generates very
large methods for complex pattern matching. It can be surprisingly
easy to hit Java's limit and produce and exception in compilation. There
is [an open bug][1133] to address the problem in Scala.

There are several techniques for avoiding this limitation when writing
Unfiltered applications. One is to restructure matches so that common
cases are handled in one case, and differentiated in subsequent
matches. Instead of this:

```scala
case ConditionA(Condition1(req)) => ...
case ConditionA(Condition2(req)) => ...
```
You might write:

```scala
case ConditionA(req) => req match {
  case Condition1(_) => ...
  case Condition2(_) => ...
  case _ => Pass
}
```
Another technique is to break up your cases into logical, named
groups. These can be combined into a single intent.

```scala
val foos = unfiltered.filter.Intent {
  case ConditionA(Condition1(req)) => ...
  case ConditionA(Condition2(req)) => ...
}
val bars = unfiltered.filter.Intent {
  case ConditionB(Condition1(req)) => ...
}
val fooBar = unfiltered.filter.Planify(foos.orElse(bars))
```
For larger groupings of functionality, it may be useful to define
singleton objects holding logically divided intents.

```scala
object Foos {
  import fun.stuff.into.scope._
  def intent = unfiltered.filter.Intent {
    case ConditionA(Condition1(req)) => ...
    case ConditionA(Condition2(req)) => ...
  }
}
object Bars {
  def intent = unfiltered.filter.Intent {
    case ConditionB(Condition1(req)) => ...
  }
}
object FooBar extends unfiltered.filter.Plan {
  def intent = Foos.intent.orElse(Bars.intent)
}
```
You could also make use of separate plans, to be chained together by
the server.

```scala
object Foos extends unfiltered.filter.Plan {
  import fun.stuff.into.scope._
  def intent = {
    case ConditionA(Condition1(req)) => ...
    case ConditionA(Condition2(req)) => ...
  }
}
object Bars extends unfiltered.filter.Plan {
  def intent = {
    case ConditionB(Condition1(req)) => ...
  }
}
```
And lastly, if there is no logical way to divide up a partial function
that is large enough to cause a compilation error, you can always
split it arbitrarily with default cases:

```scala
def intent = {
  case ConditionA(Condition1(req)) => ...
  case ConditionA(Condition2(req)) => ...
  case req => req match => {
    case ConditionB(Condition1(req)) => ...
    case _ => Pass
  }
}
```
Be aware that this last intent is *defined* for all requests. Because it
includes a top-level default case, its `orElse` method will never call
a partial function passed to it. The `Pass` object however will instruct
a plan to treat requests that fall to the end as non-matching.
