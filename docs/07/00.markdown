Application Structure
---------------------

The previous section showed how to respond to requests using a simple
intent function. The building blocks of Unfiltered are easy to grasp,
but how do you build a much larger application with them?

The short answer is, *by using Scala*. Unfiltered does not impose
idioms on your application structure, it's just an HTTP translation
layer to be applied as you see fit.

That said, partial functions are not the most common entry point for
web applications and their heavy use in this context may disorient the
beginner. This section explores some logical structures to put you on
the path to determining your own application design.
