Plans and Intents
-----------------

Unfiltered conditionally handles incoming requests using partial
functions. From the application's perspective, requests are
mapped to code paths by pattern matching. The library uses
a particular vocabulary to refer to the agents of this process
without ambiguity.

* An *intent* is a partial function for matching requests.
* A *plan* binds an intent to a particular server interface.

For example, the `unfiltered.filter.Plan` trait extends the
`javax.servlet.Filter` interface. It declares an abstract `intent`
method for clients to define the intent partial function.

### Making Plans of Intents

Looking back at the example on the previous page, you might wonder
where the plan ends and the intent begins.

    import unfiltered.request._
    import unfiltered.response._
    val echo = unfiltered.filter.Planify {
       case Path(Seg(p :: Nil)) => ResponseString(p)
    }

In this case a plan is constructed directly from an anonymous partial
function—that function is the intent. We can define the same plan in
more explicit parts, as is usually necessary in a larger application.

    object Echo extends unfiltered.filter.Plan {
      def intent = {
        case Path(Seg(p :: Nil)) => ResponseString(p)
      }
    }

Since this kind of plan is an implementation of the servlet filter
interface, we can pass it directly to a servlet container.

    unfiltered.jetty.Http.anylocal.filter(Echo).run()
