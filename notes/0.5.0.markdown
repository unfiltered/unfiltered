### Library

New [unfiltered-agents][agents] module for targeting and identifying
common [user agents][ua] provided by [chrislewis][clewis]

### Upload

`unfiltered-upload`s `StreamedFileWrapper#stream` method now returns a
generic type `T` [#47][i47]

### Scalate

Display of template compilation errors in development mode and fix for
additional attribute overrides was contributed by [teamon][scalate].

### Netty

Unfiltered's Netty support undergoes a number of changes with this
release. Most noticeably, applications are now required to define
exception handling behavior for both `async.Plan` and `cycle.Plan`,
and request execution behavior for the `cycle.Plan`. Details are
available in the [expanded Unfiltered documentation][netty].

`netty-server` now depends on the `netty` module. This will provide
more design consistency when implementing server behavior. If you were
depending on `unfiltered-netty` before, you likely need to depend
on `unfiltered-netty-server` now.

There is a new `resources` method in the `netty-server` module's
`Http` and `Https` objects. By default, this handler will pass netty
MessageEvents upstream if a file can not be resolved. To return
`NotFound` or `Forbidden` responses for stand-alone static resource
servers, use `Http(...).resources(url, passOnFail = false)`

`netty-server` `Http` and `Https` objects now define `local` and
`anylocal` methods for binding to loopback interfaces

Headers parsed as Dates should now be parsed using a US Locale to
avoid potentional conflict when parsing dates
