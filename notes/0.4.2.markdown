### Library

New [unfiltered-agents][agents] module for targeting and identifying
common [user agents][ua] provided by [chrislewis][clewis]

### Netty

`netty-server` now depends on the `netty` module. This will provide
more design consistency when implementing server behavior.

Added a `resources` method to the `netty-server` module's `Http` and
`Https` objects. By default, this handler will pass netty
MessageEvents upstream if a file can not be resolved. To return
`NotFound` or `Forbidden` responses for stand-alone static resource
servers, use `Http(...).resources(url, passOnFail = false)`

`netty-server` `Http` and `Https` objects now define `local` and
`anylocal` methods for binding to loopback interfaces

Headers parsed as Dates should now be parsed using a US Locale to
avoid potentional conflict when parsing dates

### Upload

`unfiltered-upload`s `StreamedFileWrapper#stream` method now returns a
generic type `T` [#47][i47]

### Scalate

Display of template compilation errors in development mode and fix for
additional attribute overrides, contributed by [teamon][scalate].
