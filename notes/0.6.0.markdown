#### Cookies changes

We've added support for the
[HttpOnly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#HttpOnly_cookie)
and Version, properties of cookies. This change affects the source of
extraction of Cookies. Rather than delegating to `HttpRequest`,
Cookies are now extracted directly from the headers of an HTTP request
on demand. Since this change added two new properties to the Cookie
case class, this affects any cookie extraction you may be doing.

We have removed the deprecated methods on `Cookie`: `domain`, `path`,
`maxAge`, and `secure` in favor of using built-in support for named
arguements provided by Scala case classes.

`ResponseCookies` has been deprecated in favor of `SetCookies` which
is more in line with the `Set-Cookie` header it wraps.

The `SetCookies` response function also provides a convenience method
to discard client cookies

    SetCookies.discarding(name0, ..., nameN)

The method `cookies` on `unfiltered.request.HttpRequest` has been
deprecated along with the `cookies` method implementations defined on
`unfiltered.filter.RequestBinding` and
`unfiltered.netty.RequestBinding`

### Routes

Unfiltered now includes additional options for requests routing in
[unfiltered.kit.Routes][routes]. Applications that dispatch requests
based on many different paths can use the provided kits to centralize
and isolate their path routing.

Three different kinds of routing are provided, with examples in the
test specifications. `Routes.specify` ([specs][specify]) uses
Rails-style route definitions, `Routes.regex` ([specs][regex]) uses
regular expressions, and `Routes.startsWith` ([specs][starts]) performs
a simple match against the beginning of the path.
